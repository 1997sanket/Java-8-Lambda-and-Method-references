## Getting Started
1. I want to thank my CDAC Java professor. GOD OF JAVA, Mr. Nitin Vijaykar.
   His in-depth teaching got me really interested in Java, and is the sole reason why I am always trying to understand all of its mysteries.

2. Thank you Nitin Sir. 

3. Forever a student of Java, just like you :)

4. I would also like to thank my other Java teachers such as Kaushik from Java Brains, Durga Sir on Youtube.
